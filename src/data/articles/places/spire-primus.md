Spire Primus is the largest monolith in the world, its massive platinum spire, occupied by the noble and political families and figureheads, stretches nearly to the clouds.

## Life in the Spire

The few who reside in the Upper spire itself live a life of enormous privilege, and power. Access to the finest of the merchant guild’s vendors, the League’s technology, and the Drethe’s information allows the likes long ruling Houses of Cabaal and House Ztetch to continually expand their reach.

The lower spire: Dignitaries, ruling party politicians, higher ranking law enforcement. Mostly upper class, still very clean and new.

## Subdivisions

[The Rave](/articles/places/the-rave) - The most populated public zone in the spire. Epicenter of industry, trading, research, and politics mix together in a volatile environment, where wealth meets poverty, and security contests with survival. The largest interconnected area of free travel in the spire.

[The Underhive](/articles/places/the-underhive) - A ruinous region of old-city. Structurally unsound, perilous area entered only to harvest resources.

[The Sump](/articles/places/the-sump) - A toxic area of chemicals and decay at the bottom of the undercity, polluted by millenia of seeping waste from the spire above.
