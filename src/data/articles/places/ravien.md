Ravien is the world - one massive city, largely building upon itself over millennia. Barely any of the planet's surface remains exposed to the open sky.

Ravien is littered with rising, wide-bottomed spires of buildings and structures, called Monoliths, which serve as the population hubs of the world. They are both the best (top) and worst (bottom) places to live on the metropolis-planet. Despite the inequality, all districts and levels inside the monoliths all share one thing in common; opportunity.
