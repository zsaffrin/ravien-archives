The Flats are the "suburbs" of [Ravien](/articles/places/ravien). Though the reputation of that area is the inverse of what we may expect today. the flats are the
endless connecting city-regions that never really became a hub of activity and life like the areas where the Monoliths rose upon themselves over the millennia. They
are at best middle-class, and usually closer to borderline subsistance/poverty we'd expect in urban life. They are far more exposed to the brutal elements since there aren't
layers and layers of city insulating it like that of a Monolith's interior.

Basically everyone wants to get out of the flats an into a Monolith, and [Spire Primus](/articles/places/spire-primus) is the biggest and best there is, and your lottery came up and you passed all the paperwork you needed
to in order to move.
