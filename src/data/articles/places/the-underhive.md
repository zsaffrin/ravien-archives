The Underhive is a ruinous region of old-city, too structurally unsound and otherwise perilous of an area to support anyone but the bravest, or most foolish, trying to eek out a living from harvesting its resources. Horrible creatures have been known to reside from here, sometimes even tales of something rising from [The Sump](/places/the-sump).
