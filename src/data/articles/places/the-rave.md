The Rave is the most populated public zone in [Spire Primus](/places/spire-primus). This epicenter of industry, trading, research, and politics mix together in a volatile environment, where wealth meets poverty, and security contests with survival. The heart of the monolith, it is the largest interconnected area of free travel in the spire.

The Rave consists of the many districts that span from just below the border-walls of the lower spire, to far downwards, nearing the fringes of [The Underhive](/places/the-underhive). This bustling center is a crossroads for all walks of life in the city.

Life here is hectic, and nothing is certain. Your connections and social standings will mean you eat or starve, you protect yourself, or seek protection. Everyone runs with a group, the only way someone survives is with someone watching your back in the crowded tangle of tunnels, shops, houses and.

Though throughout the districts, certain guilds and houses have made a name for themselves, often recruiting new members and growing their influence through reputation alone.
