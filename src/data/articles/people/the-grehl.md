**CURRENT ATTITUDE** - Neutral

The Grehl are essentially a worker's union that's become something of an identity for their members. They are comprised of a laboring class of workers, primarily low-skill, not to be confused with more skilled smiths or certain artisans. They primarily deal with the public-works in the Rave, servicing water, lighting, and other essential functions, and receive direction from local politicians, who receive their orders from the Spire's ruling-class directly. Because the ruling houses employ most of the Grehl leadership, they also are one of the few groups with unfettered access to the Underhive and its vast resources, which the Spire tightly controls.

The members are made up of a large variety of mixed races, more so than any other guild. Often, the mutated and less desirable members of their own races find work with the Grehl, or less civil races that don't require many personal interactions, or for jobs where a trait of these individuals can be exploited, like radiation resistance or brute strength. The Grehl are often not the most intelligent, but their leadership council is quite cunning, and the group has staved off many attempts to cut off their way of life. The Grehl are largely neutral towards non-guild members, either keeping a low profile, or assuring non-interference in Grehl activities. They are very defensive and aggressive in responding to unauthorized activity, or aggression or harassment of their own.
