# David the Gnome

The one word to describe David the Gnome is kleptomaniac and you would be a fool to fully trust him. While stealing is his biggest asset, the thrill is also his biggest flaw. How he came to join our group is a story that goes back to when he met his first love.

As a young gnome, David was an entertainer for many children of the great city Quite popular for a few years, he made a decent living doing this. As the years went on and he was no longer entertaining he fell on hard times early in a gnome's life, forcing him to explore the city and fight to survive like most of its citizens. One night, hunger forced him to steal some food which unleashed something dormant in him. That moment of exhilaration, nerves, and risk/reward to him felt something he has never felt before, and now he only feels this when he fills his pockets with things that are not his. This addiction, thrill, enjoyment. and relief all rolled into one is what DTG now lives for. The next con, hustle, steal or big score is always around the corner in David's eyes.

He can also be known as a charlatan, having his ability to connect with people from his showmanship is the perfect ruse to get close to his next target to feed his addiction. Although he has many different cons, favorite scam to cheat is games of chance. He does not like rules for obvious reasons, and feeling independence is the ultimate ideal.

When he joined the our adventurers and eventually his friends, he didnt start on the best of terms.One of his normal schemes when meeting his new "friends" he immediately started acting overtly friendly to go in for a hug and dig around some pockets. Tingle, (Zach's bad), and Nox the dragonborn, all seeing right through this thin layer of niceness, while also aware of David's reputation, caught him red handed in a theft attempt. Embarrassed and scared, David talked his way out of this situation eventually swearing to everyone in the group that he would never run his cons on them again. After returning the gold and showing his abilities of distraction and theft that would inevitably help a gang, a form of uneasy alliance grew. As the years passed his abilities came in handy in this city and their strength offset his diminutive size with some burlier targets who might be looking for him........

....that's not to say he is entirely truthful with sharing ALL of his findings to the gang he's loyal to.
