# Bharash of Norixius

Strong, loyal, fierce - all trademarks of the dragonborn race.

Bharash of clan Norixius was the youngest in a family of 5. His father Rivaan was a blacksmith, his mother Da'ar a monk, both tough albeit in different ways. His oldest sibling was his sister Megren, who followed in her mother's enlightened footsteps. His brother Kal, the middle child, didn't really know his plan or place, ended up forging his own path as a street merchant (re: not the most legal of trades). Our hero, Bharash, became very much like his father, and used smithing not only as an escape, but as means to an end to help provide for his family.

As a youth, Bharash would naturally follow his brother (and his friends) around, which included a wide range of young and old tricksters, gamblers, and entertainers (maybe even a bard). The Rave is what it is, and occasionally some donnybrooks were had. Although young, Bharash was much bigger than most his age and therefore a lot tougher. He was also a much better fighter than his older brother, which both irritated and impressed Kal. Once, he caught a gnome thief trying to pick his pocket and with one swift punch, knocked him out cold. This is where he earned his name - Nox. After the gnome woke and plead his case, they came across a mutual agreement. Little did they know how much that one punch would change both of their lives.

Meanwhile, in an effort to settle him down and help him mature, Rivaan asked Nox to focus more on selling their work through the merchants guild to help provide for the family. A steady source of income was hard to come by, so Nox agreed to his father's request. He knew that times were always best when everyone pitched in and he had to do his part. They all did - parents, siblings, and friends. Everyone in their circle looked out for one another, like a family. As we know, family can have different meanings and faces, but anyone who proved themselves as strong, loyal, and fierce was someone who Nox considered family.
